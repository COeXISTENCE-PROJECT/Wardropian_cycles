We simulate 1000 agents, who everyday may: stay home, travel to A or travel to B. When they travel they have 3 routes to choose. On each route there is some small probability of a signficant disruption. Everyday the central controller applies Greedy Equalizer to assign worst so-far to the best routes. We demonstrate on fig. X that Greedy Equlizer reaches equity for all the travellers after Y days, while keeping the flow both towards A and B optimal.
